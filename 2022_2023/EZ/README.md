Note that data from these two sources did not seem to match up (e.g. some products were considered local in the processed data, but they were not considered local in the raw data) â€” the data were wrangled such that any markers from both the processed and raw data were reflected in an aggregated dataset. 

## Goals

- Visualize spend breakdowns (including by category)
- Identify high-spend items which can be swapped for better alternatives
- Integrate UMass verified and Smith verified products into certification list
- Conduct a comparison between data on Stars website for other 5-colleges
